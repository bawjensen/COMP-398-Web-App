# Homework 4

## The Code

The python code in this assignment conforms to the [PEP 8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) styleguide by Python, with the notable exception of the variable naming scheme being lowerCaseCamelCase instead of the suggested lower_case_with_underscores.

The code handled the majority of the functionality required in this assignment, but misses some of the requirements such as handling images and code blocks.
